# Bagging_Boosting
Machine Learning techniques applied to NBA Dataset

The objective is clear: determine whether a player will have a long career ( >5 years) or not based on first years performance. 

To achieve this, some simple algorithms as decision tree & random forest are used, improved by using bagging and boosting techniques. Finally, a model explanation through shapples visualization is also displayed.
